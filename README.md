# Versitron PoE Switch for Remote Monitoring in Energy Facilities

The **Versitron PoE Switch for Remote Monitoring in Energy Facilities** is purpose-built to meet the demands of utility networks and distributed energy infrastructure. By combining robust data connectivity with PoE capability, this managed switch supports long-range monitoring and control of critical power systems, even in challenging remote environments.

## Product Overview

Energy facilities such as substations, wind farms, solar plants, and pipeline stations often rely on remote monitoring systems for operational visibility and preventive maintenance. This PoE switch enables centralized power and data delivery for IP-enabled field devices — including cameras, controllers, RTUs, and sensors — over a single Ethernet cable.

## Key Features

- **Integrated PoE/PoE+**: Supplies reliable DC power to remote surveillance cameras, PLCs, and networked meters.
- **Managed Layer 2/3 Functionality**: Supports VLAN segmentation, traffic prioritization, SNMP, and redundancy protocols.
- **Remote Diagnostics**: Monitor link activity, power usage, and port health from your control center.
- **Extended Operating Range**: Fiber uplinks with SFP support enable long-distance communication between remote sites.
- **Hardened Design**: Resistant to electromagnetic interference, dust, and temperature extremes from -40°C to 75°C.
- **Redundant Power Inputs**: Ensures uninterrupted operation in critical energy delivery applications.

## Applications

- **Substation Automation**: Connect IEDs (Intelligent Electronic Devices), fault detectors, and local controllers.
- **Solar & Wind Farms**: Enable real-time monitoring of inverters, weather sensors, and security systems.
- **Pipeline and Utility Stations**: Deliver data and power to environmental sensors, IP cameras, and alarm modules.
- **Hydro Power Plants**: Integrate gate control systems and SCADA devices via a secure, unified network.
